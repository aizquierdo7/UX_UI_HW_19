            <h1>Hey there!</h1>
            <p>I'm Andrea, a UX/UI designer on a mission to improve human experiences through design.</p>
            <p>With a background in marketing, I know the value of developing a desirable product, understanding customer needs, and keeping business objectives in mind. Once I learned more about UX and human-centered design, I knew that I wanted to be part of actively building solutions that would make a meaningful impact on users!</p>
            <p>I believe that user experience design is at the perfect intersection of creativity and analysis - while there is so much room for creative expression, I love that UX design focuses on the user and that solutions are based on real, human needs.</p> 
            <p>I studied UX design through a project-based bootcamp program with UCF, which has given me a holistic view of the entire UX design process and an appreciation for working on proejcts from ideation to final product.</p>
